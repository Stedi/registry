    "description": "[Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a\nconnected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether\nto refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the\nplatform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.\n\nReversing a transfer that was made for a [destination\ncharge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of\nthe charge. It is possible to reverse a\n[transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers#transfer-options)\ntransfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the\nreversal.\n\nRelated guide: [Reversing Transfers](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers#reversing-transfers).",
