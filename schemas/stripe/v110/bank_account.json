Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.\n\nFor external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.",
