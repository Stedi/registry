  "description": "`Exchange Rate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is\ncurrently using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is\nvariable throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to\nknow the current rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user\nwith a default payment in a foreign currency).\n\nIf you want a guarantee that the charge is made with a certain exchange rate\nyou expect is current, you can pass in `exchange_rate` to charges endpoints.\nIf the value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please\nrefer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for more\ndetails.",
