  "description": "Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank\naccount details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from\nyour customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is\nreturned to your server to use. You should use our\n[recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process\nclient-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,\nand allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using\nthe API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if\nyour integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance\nthat may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with\nclient-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to\nStripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.\n\nTokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account\ninformation for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)\nobjects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that\n[Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,\nperforms best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nRelated guide: [Accept a payment](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment-charges#web-create-token)",
